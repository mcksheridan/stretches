# Stretch Timer

This is an Express application that provides a template for storing/viewing exercise routines.

Users anonymously create exercise routines and share them with other anonymous users.

Each exercise routine comes with a [timer](https://github.com/mcksheridan/timer/).
When the specified time for an exercise has concluded, the next exercise in the routine will automatically be called.
Users have the option of pausing the timer mid-exercise or restarting the timer when the entire routine has completed.

Users may add links to external images to their exercise routine as well.
